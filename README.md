The slides that this takes is a single png of all the slides. This can be generated from a google slideshow through:
1) Converting the slideshow to pdf(Google allows slideshow download to pdf.
2) Converting the slideshow to a folder of images(See websites like: https://pdf2png.com/ )
3) Merging the pngs into a single verticle png(See websites like: https://photo333.com/merge-png.php)

It is recommended to attach the slideshow to a world-constrained object for a proper presentation. This can be gotten from: https://vrlabs.dev/item/world-constraint.
